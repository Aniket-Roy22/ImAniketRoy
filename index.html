                    <p>
                        I started learning Java in 2018. It was in my school's course curriculum. I consider myself to have completed all the basics of Java. From 2018 to 2023 I learned Java; I've touched on some of DSA in this period of time also. The coding logics learnt through Java have helped me to transition to other languages smoothly.

                    <p>
                        I was introduced to C Language in 2023 which was within the course curriculum in my second semester of my undergraduate program. I also consider to have completed most of if not all the basics of C. Having learnt Java for so long, my switch to C for the first time was fairly smooth.

                        My introduction to Web Development was through a Full Stack Web Development course taught by Dr. Angela Yu which I bought in 2021 on the learning platform known as Udemy. The current website you're reading is all thanks to Dr. Angela Yu and her incredible course on Web Development.

                <p class="hobby-desc">
                    An aquarist is a person who manages aquariums, either professionally or as a hobby. They typically care for aquatic animals. Some aquarists are hobbyists, also known as "home aquarists". I've personally been a home aquarist for two years now. I would consider myself pretty skilled at maintaining this underwater ecosystem called an Aquarium.

                <p class="hobby-desc">
                    I've been interested in photography for as long as I can remember. I could only afford my first professional camera in 2024 but my phone has been more than ever for the time being. I particularly enjoy photographing still nature. Potraiture isn't one of my most enjoyed though, nor am I too skilled in that genre of photography.
